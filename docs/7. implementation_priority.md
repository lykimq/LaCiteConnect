# Priority Implementation for Microservices

## 1. Authentication and User Management Microservice

- Why First: User authentication is at the heart of the application. Without users being able to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles, nothing else can function effectively. This service handles sign-ups, logins, password resets, profile management, and user privacy settings.

- Key Features:
    + User registration, login, and password management.
    + Profile management (with pictures, name, contact details).
    + Authentication (JWT, session management).
    + Privacy settings.
    + Multi-factor authentication (e.g., biometric).

- Dependencies: None, except for potential user data access. This should be self-contained.

## 2. Main Page Information Microservice
- Why Second: The main page contains static but critical information (like the church's address, service times, and history). This should be available early as it's an informational entry point for all users.

- Key Features:
    + Church info, history, and contact information management.
    + Media management (pictures, videos).
    + Section order management.
- Dependencies: None. This is mostly static and self-contained, focusing on content delivery.

## 3. Events Microservice

- Why Third: Events are central to engagement. Users need to know about upcoming events, register for them, and be notified. This is a high-priority feature after user management and static information.

- Key Features:
    + Event creation, editing, deletion (by admins).
    + Event registration by users.
    + Event notifications.
    + Pagination, search, and filtering of events.

- Dependencies: It will depend on the Authentication & User Management service for user registration and notifications, but is largely independent.

## 4. Donations Microservice
- Why Fourth: Donations are a core part of any church app. Users should be able to donate securely (via fiat or cryptocurrency). This service will handle all financial transactions, which are very sensitive and need to be secure.

- Key Features:
    + Handle user donations (fiat and cryptocurrency).
    + Integrate with payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, Tezos).
    + Track donation history and amounts.

- Dependencies: Relies on user management (to associate donations with users). It may also depend on external payment gateways and APIs.


## 5. Home Groups Microservice
- Why Fifth: Home groups are vital for community building. After users can engage with events and donate, they can start participating in smaller, more intimate home groups. The Home Groups feature depends on event registration and user profiles.

- Key Features:
    + Home group creation, editing, and deletion.
    + Registration and management of users in home groups.
    + Pagination, search, and filtering of home groups.
    + Home group member management.

- Dependencies: Depends on user management and registration. Users need to be authenticated, and their participation in home groups needs to be tracked.

## 6. Notification Microservice
- Why Sixth: Notifications keep users engaged. They need to receive alerts for events, home group updates, and donations. This service ties together multiple aspects of your application.

- Key Features:
    + Manage notifications for events, services, donations, etc.
    + Notification types: push, SMS, and email.
    + Notification preferences for users.

- Dependencies: Tightly integrates with the Events, Home Groups, and Donations microservices. It will use the user database to send personalized notifications.

## 7. Services Microservice
- Why Seventh: Services like Bible studies, worship services, etc., are fundamental to your church app. Once users are interacting with events, donations, and home groups, they can benefit from viewing and registering for services.

- Key Features:
    + Service creation, editing, deletion (by admins).
    + Service registration by users.
    + Notifications for services.
    + Pagination, search, and filtering of services.

- Dependencies: It relies on User Management and Events, as users will need to sign in and register for services.
