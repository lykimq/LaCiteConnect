Soon after arriving, they started to hold church meetings in their lounge every Sunday. Little by little, the church put down roots and God has added to our number those who are now part of La Cité."

      "content": "Our desire and passion is to see the Kingdom of God increasingly established here in Paris. To see His City (the church), His Ways and His Reign established. This includes seeing the captives set free, physical, emotional, and spiritual healing, people realizing their unique identity and calling, as well as many other things, on Earth, in Paris, as it is in Heaven."
